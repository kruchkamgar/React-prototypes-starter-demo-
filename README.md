Get running NOW with interactive prototypes, in the most light-weight fashion possible: zero software or 'build-tooling' required.

- Create elements using JS, derived from/ using sample data [over repetitive html hardcoding].
- Organize code into components instead of large html files
- Add simple interactivity using state and conditions embedded within React components
