# React-prototypes-starter-demo-
Get running NOW with interactive prototypes, in the most light-weight fashion possible: zero software or 'build-tooling' required.

**Uses React.js without even Babel**

- Create elements using JS, derived from/ using sample data [over repetitive html hardcoding].
- Organize code into components instead of large html files
- Add simple interactivity using state and conditions embedded within React components

## Retrospective:

#### Problems with Flexbox not experienced with Grid

  Responsive
  - Must hack on css to hide items (height/width and overflow property in flex box). plenty of 'display: contents;' 
  - Easier margin specification with Grid
  - Alignment across sections (header and body elements), means less work and maintenance with Grid

  Decoration
  - grid offers control: box-shadow property (margin-bounded, with flexbox)
